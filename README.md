This is the home of a static blog I've written using Rust to generate
all of the requisite HTML.

It's meant to be an experiment in using largely pure HTML and CSS, with
only minimal JavaScript, to create an extremely fast, accessible, and
easy to read website.

## Running Locally

Just clone the directory and run `cargo run run`. To regenerate HTML
files, run `cargo run generate`.
