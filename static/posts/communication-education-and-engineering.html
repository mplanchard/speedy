        <h1 id="communication,-education,-and-engineering">Communication, Education, and Engineering <div class="anchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><a href="#communication,-education,-and-engineering">⤶</a></div></h1>
<p>I've been thinking a lot recently about communication in the context of an
engineering organization, both because of our company having gone all remote
due to the COVID-19 pandemic and because of some recent examples I have seen
of poor communication being actively harmful to the engineering organization
and culture.</p>
<p>I've been reading <em><a href="https://www.bookpeople.com/book/9781942788812">Team Topologies</a></em>, and one of its main points is that
the <em>team</em>, not the individual, is the value-creating unit in a productive
engineering organization, and that approaching business and technical
decisions in a team-oriented way is the best path to ensure high software
quality over time. I have been a firm proponent of this view for a long time,
and it's nice to see it presented in such a clear, concise way.</p>
<p>Given that a team, by definition, is made up of multiple people, it follows
that communication is a necessary skill for any given individual on the team.
For an engineering organization of any significant size, this is compounded
by the fact that teams are inevitably going to have to work together and
depend upon the products of each others' work, requiring effective communication
both intra- and inter- team.</p>
<p>The vast majority of necessary communication within an engineering organization
falls into one of two categories: learning or education. <em>Learning communication</em>
includes requests for information (both internal and external to the team or
organization), shared exploration of an unknown problem space, and much of the
small talk needed to get to know and trust our coworkers. <em>Educational communication</em>
includes providing information, sharing discoveries, and those parts of small
talk that let our colleagues get to know us. Given that virtually all necessary
communication falls into these two categories, it is essential that
team members be not only good learning communicators, able to effectively request
information and guide shared exploration, but also good educational communicators,
able to effectively convey new and complex information to a variety of audiences
(team members, stakeholders, executives, etc.).</p>
<p>Despite this, there is often not a clear definition provided in an engineering
organization of what it means to communicate well. We don't have a rubric by
which we can measure effective communication, and perhaps as a result, in
our interviews, we don't actively select for good communication skills, we don't
require writing samples to ensure an applicant's written communication is as good
as their verbal communication, and we don't assess an applicant's ability to educate
their peers. Then, once we've hired someone, we don't constantly evaluate
their communication performance in order to help them improve. As a result,
we leave to chance what is one of the most fundamental qualities of an effective
team and organization. Perhaps you have been lucky and haven't seen it in
person, but the degree to which one consistently poor communicator can
hobble a team's performance is significant.</p>
<p>While communication skills are crucial at all levels, they become exponentially more
important as an employee's rank becomes more senior. Hiring or promoting
someone to a senior level explicitly labels that person as exemplary, as
someone to whom junior employees should look to for professional and technical
leadership. It should therefore be expected that leaders in an organization spend
more time communicating, that their communication is held to a higher standard,
and that the overall balance of their communication shifts towards the
educational side. By spending time communicating and teaching,
engineering leaders enable significantly faster growth and better performance
of their peers, while improving visibility into complex technical
issues at the organizational level through effective representation of the
team's work and progress. For a team-oriented organization, this is the force
multiplier that engineering leaders provide and how they justify their
higher salaries.</p>
<p>There is generally no place in a team-oriented engineering organization
for lone wolves, rockstars, divas, or however else you might label someone
who is an excellent <em>technical</em> performer, but who cannot work effectively
on a team. There might of course be exceptions for individuals who are
exceptionally talented and who are already distinguished leaders in their
field, but these individuals are so rare that they aren't worth considering
as part of the normal course of operations. 99.999% of &quot;rockstar developers&quot;
are not Linus Torvalds; they are just slightly better than average developers
with poor communication skills, who will in subtle and not-so-subtle ways
create deep pools of toxicity when an organization attempts to integrate
them into a team. This toxicity is rather like nuclear waste. The longer
it remains, the more pronounced its effects become, and the resultant
irradiation remains for a long time even after the offending individual is
removed.</p>
<p>But what does effective learning and educational communication look like?
This article will attempt to enumerate some principles for effective communication,
with the goal being to provide a basis for which an individual or an organization
might evaluate the effectiveness of their communication, and to provide
a chance to get onto paper the communication ideals that I personally
aim for in my own career.</p>
<h2 id="general-principles-of-all-communication">General Principles of All Communication <div class="anchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><a href="#general-principles-of-all-communication">⤶</a></div></h2>
<p>Within a team-oriented organization, it is critical that all communication
adhere to certain standards. Without these, communication can fail to serve
its purpose as a bridge and a conduit of information, and instead become a
wedge and a source of obfuscation. The following principles apply to all
communication, regardless of whether it is written or spoken, official or
unofficial, synchronous or asynchronous.</p>
<h3 id="be-respectful">Be Respectful <div class="anchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><a href="#be-respectful">⤶</a></div></h3>
<p>All communication <strong>MUST</strong> be respectful. Full stop. There is absolutely no
place in an effective team for condescension, rudeness, or aggression.</p>
<p>Respectful communication is communication that <a href="#assume-good-faith">assumes good faith</a>,
is <a href="#be-charitable">charitable to others</a>, and which <a href="#follow-the-golden-rule">follows the golden rule</a>.
We'll discuss each of these components individually in a bit more detail.</p>
<h4 id="assume-good-faith">Assume Good Faith <div class="anchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><a href="#assume-good-faith">⤶</a></div></h4>
<p>In an effective organization, every individual is working for the good of the
whole. We must therefore assume that their communication is in good faith.
When they ask questions, we must assume they are making honest attempts to learn,
and we must respond as educators, doing our best to provide answers.</p>
<p>We must also come from a position of good faith. We should aim to accomplish
either learning or education in all of our communication, and must never
pollute that purpose with sneaky attempts to show someone up or to prove
we are clever.</p>
<h4 id="be-charitable">Be Charitable <div class="anchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><a href="#be-charitable">⤶</a></div></h4>
<p>It is critical to recognize that people are coming to any given nexus of
communication from vastly different backgrounds, not only in a longer-term sense
in terms of their personal and professional backgrounds but also in a shorter-term
sense in terms of what they have been thinking about or working on recently.</p>
<p>For example, when someone asks a question that has already been answered,
asks a question we feel they should already know the answer to, or makes a
point that shows a lack of understanding, it is essential that we consider
the underlying reasons with charity. Perhaps they have had a very busy day
and only skimmed the discussion. Maybe they're doing fifteen things and once
and got something confused. They might just still be learning. Regardless,
we should use this as an opportunity to ensure that we have have done a
sufficient job of educating. Could we have presented the idea more clearly?
Is there some confusing indirection or obfuscation that we didn't notice
because we were so deep in the problem? Is there documentation that we
can point to to clear things up?</p>
<p>One of the most valuable lessons that I learned when I was teaching college
classes was that <em>the vast majority of the time</em> a student's failure to
understand something was not because of anything intrinsic to the student,
but because I was not explaining the topic in a way that made sense to them.
We must assume that our coworkers are what they so often are: smart,
busy people who just want to help the team make something they can be proud of.</p>
<h4 id="follow-the-golden-rule">Follow the Golden Rule <div class="anchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><a href="#follow-the-golden-rule">⤶</a></div></h4>
<p>In communication, as in most things, we should follow the golden rule,
&quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&quot; Treat others with the
same respect that you would want for yourself. Assume they are smart and
capable people. Assume they are not being willfully mean or vindictive.
Always give them the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<h3 id="be-direct">Be Direct <div class="anchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><a href="#be-direct">⤶</a></div></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I meant what I said and I said what I meant.</p>
<p>— Dr. Seuss, <em>Horton Hatches the Egg</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we cannot honestly say, like the elephant in the Dr. Seuss classic, that
we said exactly what we meant, and that we meant what we said, than we cannot
say that we were communicating effectively.</p>
<p>Reading between the lines should never be a necessary part of business
communication. If some work requires changes, we must say so. If something is
not excellent, it does no one any good to say that it is. We should always seek
out and emphasize what is praiseworthy in our colleagues' work, but we <em>also</em>
must not avoid critique because we are afraid of hurting feelings.</p>
<p>Of course, being direct cannot exist in isolation, without <em>also</em> applying
the rest of these principles, especially being respectful. One cannot justify
rudeness, impatience, or condescension by hiding behind the veil of directness.</p>
<h3 id="be-clear">Be Clear <div class="anchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><a href="#be-clear">⤶</a></div></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>It is all very well for you to write simply and the simpler the better.
But do not start to think so damned simply. Know how complicated it is
and then state it simply.</p>
<p>— Ernest Hemingway</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We work in a complicated industry making complicated things. We must therefore
aim to speak and write clearly, and always with our audience in mind. Use jargon
when speaking or writing for a technical audience, but leave it out when
communicating to the broader organization. Strive to keep sentences and language
as simple as possible.</p>
<p>This principle is especially important in technical and project planning.
Using overly complicated language or not taking the time to find a way to
describe something in a simple way can cause real consequences down the line.
If reviewers fail to fully grasp a topic because of grandiose language
or overly complicated descriptions, they may also fail to see critical issues
in the design. Someone implementing a technical plan later on may fall afoul
of the same problem and encode that poor understanding into the system itself.
In this way, poor communication can become technical debt.</p>
<h3 id="be-honest">Be Honest <div class="anchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><a href="#be-honest">⤶</a></div></h3>
<p>Being honest is somewhat correlated to being direct, but applies more broadly.
An effective team is one in which every team member is comfortable being
honest. It is therefore critical that we strive to be honest, and perhaps
even more importantly, that we create an environment where we expect and
encourage honesty.</p>
<p>Failures to live up to this principle show up all over an engineering
organization. An environment in which a team is uncomfortable being honest
about estimates due to strict timeline expectations will lead to unnecessary
padding and descoping of features. A team with a poor manager will be hesitant
to say anything in skip-levels if there are concerns about politics being
more important than honesty. An individual on a team will be hesitant to
share that they are having problems with a task and ask for help if their
team does not communicate honestly and respectfully.</p>
<h2 id="putting-good-communication-into-practice">Putting Good Communication into Practice <div class="anchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><a href="#putting-good-communication-into-practice">⤶</a></div></h2>
<p>We must ensure that we are applying these principles in our own communication
and that we are clearly communicating and enforcing them as expectations in our
organizations, if we expect to be effective. What follows is a by no means
complete list of ways that we as individuals and leaders can make that happen.</p>
<h3 id="communicate-the-importance-of-communication">Communicate the Importance of Communication <div class="anchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><a href="#communicate-the-importance-of-communication">⤶</a></div></h3>
<p>It should be 100% clear to all employees that communication is a core value
and competency of a company. Communication principles should be covered in
onboarding and should be readily accessible from company and project
documentation. The importance of communication should be emphasized frequently
in training, presentations, and evaluations.</p>
<h3 id="always-be-editing">Always Be Editing <div class="anchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><a href="#always-be-editing">⤶</a></div></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In writing, you must kill all your darlings.</p>
<p>— William Faulkner (possibly apocryphal)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Written communication should almost never be submitted without at least
one round of editing (with perhaps the exception of instant messaging).
Whether submitting comments on someone's code, writing documentation,
or preparing a technical document, write it, read it, and then read it again,
keeping the principles of effective communication in mind and ruthlessly
editing so that your writing adheres to them.</p>
<p>Faulkner's quote above applies directly to the editing process. When we write,
we may often become emotionally attached to our own writing, perhaps savoring a
particularly clever sentence or an amusing idiom. However strong that attachment
may be, we must recognize that in business our writing exists not to
make us feel good about ourselves, but to communicate something important.
If we must kill our darlings in service of better communication, so be it.</p>
<h3 id="recognize-the-importance-of-education">Recognize the Importance of Education <div class="anchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><a href="#recognize-the-importance-of-education">⤶</a></div></h3>
<p>If I had to quantify my time, I would guess that I spend approximately 60%
of my working hours in communication, with most of that being educational
communication. Does this mean I do less hands-on coding? Of course! But
there is no doubt that the time I spend making suggestions on others'
code, shedding light on legacy decisions, and writing about
upcoming projects allows my team to do more and do it faster than would
otherwise be possible. I am just one set of hands on the keyboard, and a day
of my work cannot come close to the output I can provide by accelerating or
unblocking the entire team. Because I have the knowledge and context to do
that, it would be a waste of resources for me to spend all my time coding.</p>
<p>It is critical that a team-oriented organization recognizes
and facilitates this kind of educational communication. Formalize pairing
sessions and knowledge transfer between senior and junior members of the team.
Regardless of organizational level, ensure that team members who have more
context on any particular area of the domain share that knowledge with the
rest of the team. Put engineering leaders on documentation tasks, and ensure
that the value of documentation is firmly communicated in engineering principles.
Encourage frequent and informal presentations such as &quot;lunch and
learns&quot; or intra-team demos that allow people to share knowledge in a way that
is not threatening and doesn't require  a lot of activation energy.</p>
<h3 id="invest-in-educational-artifacts">Invest in Educational Artifacts <div class="anchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><a href="#invest-in-educational-artifacts">⤶</a></div></h3>
<p>Code documentation, code comments, team process and procedure documentation,
technical planning documents, architecture decision records, and company-wide
documentation all have something in common: they are <em>educational artifacts</em>,
products of someone's labor whose purpose is to offload the educational burden
and allow it to be asynchronous. They ensure that understanding is encoded in
a common place, reducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a>, and they free up the time that
otherwise would have been spent educating each new employee on the content
of the artifact.</p>
<p>These educational artifacts are critical to the success of an organization,
and they must receive the same care as functional artifacts, such as releases
of product code. We should take care that all of our principles of communication
are applied when writing and reviewing educational artifacts, and that
we make discovery of these artifacts as smooth and streamlined as
possible. We should also ensure that creating educational artifacts is low-friction,
whether that be through providing a freely editable wiki, allowing
engineers to write documentation alongside code, or whatever else
works for the team.</p>
<h3 id="hire-for-effective-communication">Hire for Effective Communication <div class="anchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><a href="#hire-for-effective-communication">⤶</a></div></h3>
<p>I know that cover letters have largely fallen out of style, but I think
they can provide great value as a writing sample. If not requiring a cover
letter, require some other writing sample as part of the interview
process. Evaluate it in terms of the organization's communication principles
and whether it does an effective job of educating the interviewer.</p>
<p>In addition to assessing written communication skill, we MUST do a better
job as an industry of digging into an applicant's learning and educational communication
during the interview process. Perhaps instead of algorithms on a whiteboard,
we could assess learning communication skills by assigning a task with
minimal information that <em>requires</em> asking questions of the interviewer
in order to determine the full requirements and appropriate path forward.
Similarly, perhaps instead of solely asking questions of the interviewee,
we could have <em>them</em> teach <em>us</em> something, perhaps a presentation on some
technology they find interesting or an architecture they would propose to
solve a problem. This idea is shamelessly stolen from the process of applying
to be a college instructor, where you will often be asked to give a lecture
as part of the interview process. For this latter challenge, we should of
course let them know beforehand what they will be discussing. After all,
having to both figure something out and present it simultaneously is rather
unrealistic (and many people's worst nightmare). We cannot teach what we do
not already know.</p>
<h3 id="expect-failure,-and-be-willing-to-forgive">Expect Failure, and Be Willing to Forgive <div class="anchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><a href="#expect-failure,-and-be-willing-to-forgive">⤶</a></div></h3>
<p>Of course, no one is perfect, and part of treating ourselves and others with
respect is accepting the fact that we will all sometimes fall short of our
ideals.</p>
<p>Much like blameless retrospectives for technical failures, managers
should meet with employees and look back on cases where they failed to
communicate in a productive way. We should strive to find the root of the failure.
For example, someone losing their temper is often a sign that they are feeling a lot
of pressure or are overworked. We should strive to address these root causes,
while also expecting that individuals be willing to recognize, own up to, and atone
for their failures. Whenever we fail to communicate respectfully and potentially
hurt our relationships with others, we must be willing to put forth
the extra effort required to heal that wound, generally by admitting that
we failed, apologizing, and trying to do better going forward.</p>
<h3 id="remove-toxic-individuals">Remove Toxic Individuals <div class="anchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><a href="#remove-toxic-individuals">⤶</a></div></h3>
<p>While we all fail to live up to our ideals sometimes, we must not tolerate
individuals who consistently fail to do so and show no signs of remorse
or desire to improve. Keeping poor communicators around, particularly
in positions of leadership, can create deep and long-lasting wounds in
teams and organizations. We must therefore be willing to address problems
as soon as we see them, and if we cannot fix the problem by working
with the individual, we must quickly remove them from the organization.
Ultimately, this decision must be guided by the principle of preventing harm
to the <em>rest</em> of the team and the organization.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions <div class="anchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><a href="#conclusions">⤶</a></div></h2>
<p>Hopefully it is clear that communication is fundamental to the success of any
organization, particularly any organization where the fundamental units
of value are teams. Within an engineering organization, most if not all
necessary communication is either learning or educational communication.
Engineering leaders particularly must be expected to be excellent educators
as well as excellent programmers, and there is no room in most team-oriented
organizations for lone wolf, rockstar developers.</p>
<p>Good communication is respectful, direct, clear, and honest. We should strive
to hold ourselves and others to these ideals of good communication in every
context, whether spoken or written, persistent or transient. Consistent
application of good communication helps teams maximize trust, understanding,
and knowledge transfer, ultimately making them more effective units within
the broader organization.</p>
<p>As individuals and as organizations, we can and must take concrete steps to
make good communication a core value. We must ruthlessly evaluate our own
communication to ensure that we are living up to our own ideals. We must
ensure that our hiring process looks not only at technical ability, but also at
learning and educational communication. We must ensure that the educational role
of our engineers is encouraged and respected. We must ensure that our
educational artifacts receive the same care as our functional ones. Finally,
we must be kind and generous in allowing for the times that we fail to live
up to our expectations. However, when it becomes clear that a member of a team
cannot communicate effectively, we must remove them quickly to avoid damaging the
team.</p>
