<p>Here is a selection of articles and other media that I’ve found interesting
since the last installment of this series. I’ve started providing archive
links in addition to the original URLs, in case in the future the original
sites change URLs, go down, etc. Please prefer the original links when
possible.</p>

<p>This article goes in depth into the utility of standardizing column
names in a data schema, to the point where it’s possible to treat the
names as contracts, even building automated tooling around them. In
addition to being interesting in the specific, it makes a good general
point about the value of standardization in naming.</p>

<p>The author of this post is a prolific open source contributor, having
written ripgrep, the most popular Rust regular expression engine, the
most popular Rust CSV parser, the main Golang TOML parser, a property
testing library for Rust, an X window manager in Golang, and so on.
This article chronicles his experience contributing to open source,
maintaining projects, and so on. It’s a great, measured look at the
experience from the perspective of a well respected member of the
community. This article was published way back in January, but I think
an update put it back into my RSS feed, and I figured there’s no harm
in re-highlighting it.</p>

<p>This post calls out the western media for in large part completely failing
to report on the relative successes with COVID management seen in a
number of non-white, non-wealthy, non-western countries, such as Thailand,
Vietnam, Rwanda, and Ghana, making the rather difficult to refute case
that the media tends to present the success of those countries, when it’s
mentioned at all, as being due to luck or genetics, failing to consider
the details of these countries public health responses, which have often
been comprehensive and, apparently, quite effective.</p>

<p>This is a fantastic article going into the depths of relative performance
of various low-level synchronization primitives in situations of low,
medium, and high thread saturation. An absolute must-read and must-bookmark
for anyone needing to choose between atomics, mutexes, or other
synchronization primitives in their code.</p>

<p>A nice primer on some of the ways that you can optimize your data structures
to enable faster processing, fewer cache misses, etc. This kind of
data-oriented design has the potential to significantly improve the
performance of processing large amounts of data or smaller amounts of
data in hot paths, and seems like a really useful set of skills to be
aware of.</p>

<p>You’d think this sort of thing would stop surprising me, but the degree
to which a significant portion of the country seem to be <em>just fine</em> with
the White House intercepting basic science and public health messaging
and spinning it to its own ends continue to floor me, especially when it’s
as flagrant as this.</p>

<p>This article makes the case that VSCode is ushering in a new era of text
editor dominance, brought on by having perfected the extension model and
having the benefit of continuous open source development by Microsoft.
It’s a little breathlessly uncritical for my taste, but I do think it’s
worth considering whether VSCode may be the IDE/editor outside of vim
and emacs to potentially achieve long-term success.</p>

<p>This “Fireside Friday” post by Bret Devereux looks at the value proposition
of college in modern American society, particularly what it is about
a college education that remains a strong signal for employers. Like
everything he writes, this is perceptive, nuanced, and interesting.</p>
