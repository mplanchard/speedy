        <h1>Creating an RSS (Atom) Feed</h1>
<p>The main way that I keep up with blogs is through RSS. I have been using
the excellent <a href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> since whenever Google Reader
shut down, with <a href="https://feedly.com/i/welcome">Feedly</a> as the backend.
Naturally, I therefore would like for my own blog to have an
RSS feed. This serves two purposes: one, it helps any interested people to
keep up with the blog, and two, if I put it in my feed, it will give me
a second opportunity to proofread things that I post.</p>
<p>This post will follow the process of making an RSS feed from scratch.
I figured that, in the spirit of this generally handcrafted blog experience,
I might as well make it myself rather than going with some third-party
service.</p>
<h2>RSS or Atom</h2>
<p>One very quickly learns that there are two competing specifications in the
real simple syndication world. <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS 2.0</a>, published in
2003, was the successor to the original RSS specification and was the
dominant player prior to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">Atom</a>, published in 2005 with
what seems to my uneducated eye to be a bit more of a formal specification.</p>
<p>Web searches like &quot;rss vs atom&quot; aren't particularly enlightening as to what
might lead one to pick one or the other feed format, although it does
seem to be a topic that several blog-related companies have written fluff
pieces about in order to improve their SEO, which I will refrain from linking
here. Fluff aside, I did manage to find a <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed/issues/2">more substantive discussion</a>
on the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed">jekyll-feed GitHub repository</a>.
There's also <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2013/09/23/">this post from the <em>null program</em> blog</a>,
which looks at some of the details about the pain points in the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS specification</a>
as compared to the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">Atom specification</a>. There's also a <a href="https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/2922/should-i-provide-rss-or-atom-feeds">question from 2010</a>
on the Wordpress StackExchange.</p>
<p>From reading through those links, what I've gathered is mostly that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basically any feed aggregator/reader supports both Atom and RSS feeds</li>
<li>Publishing podcasts on iTunes requires an RSS feed</li>
<li>The Atom specification is more well defined and by most accounts easier
to work with</li>
</ul>
<p>Given all of that, I think that I'll probably start with Atom, and then
potentially add an RSS feed as well later on.</p>
<h2>Implementing Atom</h2>
<p>I started out by reading the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">Atom specification</a>, which is actually quite
an easy read. It gives some examples of Atom documents, one of which I
copied over to form the base of my template. From there, I started reading
up on the definitions for the various elements of the specification. There
are top-level metadata attributes that can be specified for a feed, most
of which are fairly straightforward (<code>author</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>updated</code>, etc.).
Feed entries are specified in an <code>entry</code> element, which contains information
about the individual entry.</p>
<h3>Unique IDs</h3>
<p>One of the components of the Atom specification is that each entry have
a unique ID. This honestly isn't something I planned for when I was
originally coding the site, because none of the content exists in a
database. However, there is an assumption that each blog post's slug
will be unique, since the slugs are used as the path in the URL.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">atom specification</a> has this to say about the ID element:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Its content MUST be an IRI, as defined by [RFC3987].  Note that the
definition of &quot;IRI&quot; excludes relative references.  Though the IRI
might use a dereferencable scheme, Atom Processors MUST NOT assume it
can be dereferenced.</p>
<p>When an Atom Document is relocated, migrated, syndicated,
republished, exported, or imported, the content of its atom:id
element MUST NOT change.  Put another way, an atom:id element
pertains to all instantiations of a particular Atom entry or feed;
revisions retain the same content in their atom:id elements.  It is
suggested that the atom:id element be stored along with the
associated resource.</p>
<p>The content of an atom:id element MUST be created in a way that
assures uniqueness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That description, along with their example ID of
<code>urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a</code>, got me going down a bit
of a rabbit hole of trying to figure out how to hash the slug and
represent it as an IRI, but the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/atom.html">w3c validator introduction to atom</a>
makes things a lot less scary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Identifies the entry using a universally unique and permanent URI.
Suggestions on how to make a good id can be found here. Two entries in
a feed can have the same value for id if they represent the same entry
at different points in time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their example ID is just <code>&lt;id&gt;http://example.com/blog/1234&lt;/id&gt;</code>. Since
we have unique URIs for our posts, we can just use those. Phew!</p>
<h3>Templates</h3>
<p>Atom's a pretty simple format, so we just need two templates, one for the
page and another for entries:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!-- atom.xml --&gt;

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;feed xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom&quot;&gt;

    &lt;title&gt;Matthew Planchard's Blog&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;self&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.mplanchard.com/atom.xml&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;link href=&quot;https://blog.mplanchard.com/&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;updated&gt;{{ updated }}&lt;/updated&gt;
    &lt;author&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Matthew Planchard&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;/author&gt;
    &lt;id&gt;https://blog.mplanchard.com/&lt;/id&gt;

    {{ entries }}

&lt;/feed&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!-- atom-entry.xml --&gt;

&lt;entry&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link href=&quot;{{ link }}&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;id&gt;{{ link }}&lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;updated&gt;{{ updated }}&lt;/updated&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;{{ summary }}&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;/entry&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3>The Rust!</h3>
<p>With all of the refactoring we did as part of
<a href="/posts/adding-support-for-tags-1.html">adding tag support</a>, this is
pretty easy.</p>
<p>First, we add our page template to our
<a href="https://github.com/mplanchard/speedy/blob/ed60e0eb767a60e1371401b0741c2add86d01b08/src/main.rs#L114-L119"><code>TemplatePageStrings</code> struct</a>
and its <a href="https://github.com/mplanchard/speedy/blob/ed60e0eb767a60e1371401b0741c2add86d01b08/src/main.rs#L146-L151">const instance</a>,
and add a parser to our <code>PageTemplates</code> struct:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">struct TemplatePageStrings {
    about: &amp;'static str,
    atom: &amp;'static str,
    generic: &amp;'static str,
    index: &amp;'static str,
    post: &amp;'static str,
}
// ...
const TEMPLATE_STRINGS: TemplateStrings = TemplateStrings {
    // ...
    pages: TemplatePageStrings {
        about: include_str!(&quot;../templates/pages/about.html&quot;),
        atom: include_str!(&quot;../templates/pages/atom.xml&quot;),
        generic: include_str!(&quot;../templates/pages/generic.html&quot;),
        index: include_str!(&quot;../templates/pages/index.html&quot;),
        post: include_str!(&quot;../templates/pages/post.html&quot;),
    },

    // ...
struct PageTemplates {
    about: liquid::Template,
    atom: liquid::Template,
    generic: liquid::Template,
    index: liquid::Template,
    post: liquid::Template,
}
impl PageTemplates {
    fn new(parser: &amp;liquid::Parser) -&gt; Self {
        let parse = |template_str| parse_template_str(parser, template_str);
        Self {
            about: parse(TEMPLATE_STRINGS.pages.about),
            atom: parse(TEMPLATE_STRINGS.pages.atom),
            generic: parse(TEMPLATE_STRINGS.pages.generic),
            index: parse(TEMPLATE_STRINGS.pages.index),
            post: parse(TEMPLATE_STRINGS.pages.post),
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>As a side note, we might eventually do a post on macros to make it easier
to get these templates made :)</p>
<p>From there, we do the same thing for the snippet template in its struct
and instance, although I won't bore you with that.</p>
<p>We need to add two rendering methods to the <code>Context</code> struct, one for
atom entries and another for the atom page. The first looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">impl&lt;'a&gt; Context&lt;'a&gt; {
    // ...
    fn render_atom_entry(&amp;self, post: &amp;Post) -&gt; String {
        let globals = liquid::value::Object::from_iter(vec![
            (&quot;title&quot;.into(), to_liquid_val(&amp;post.metadata.title)),
            (&quot;link&quot;.into(), to_liquid_val(&amp;post.url)),
            (
                &quot;updated&quot;.into(), to_liquid_val(
                    DateTime::&lt;Utc&gt;::from_utc(
                        post.metadata.updated.and_hms(0, 0, 0), Utc
                    ).to_rfc3339())
            ),
            (&quot;summary&quot;.into(), to_liquid_val(&amp;post.metadata.summary)),
        ]);
        self.templates
            .snippets
            .atom_entry
            .render(&amp;globals)
            .expect(&amp;format!(&quot;failed to reader atom entry for {:?}&quot;, post))
    }
    // ...
</code></pre>
<p>Because I only store the date of the last update, and the atom spec wants
a datetime, I decided just to represent it as the time at midnight UTC,
for entirely arbitrary reasons.</p>
<p>Rendering a <em>page</em> is a little more complicated, at least if we want to
avoid adding multiple iterations through our posts. This is because one
of the things that the spec reuqires is an <code>&lt;updated&gt;</code> tag for the feed
as a whole. This is fine, because I store this information, but the posts
are stored in the <code>Context</code> struct in order by creation date. So, I need
to iterate over them, get the most recent update date, and also render
them all into <code>atom-entry</code> format, ideally all in one loop, and ideally
functionally!</p>
<p>I wound up doing this by bifurcating the result of a <code>.fold()</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">    fn render_atom_page(&amp;self) -&gt; String {
        // Get the most recently updated entry and a string of rendered
        // &lt;entry&gt; documents, separated by newlines.
        let (updated, entries) = self.posts.iter().fold(
            (NaiveDate::from_ymd(1, 1, 1), String::new()),
            |(newest_date, entries), post| {
                (
                    if post.metadata.updated &gt; newest_date {
                        post.metadata.updated
                    } else {
                        newest_date
                    },
                    [entries, self.render_atom_entry(post)].join(&quot;\n&quot;),
                )
            },
        );
        let globals = liquid::value::Object::from_iter(vec![
            (
                &quot;updated&quot;.into(),
                to_liquid_val(Self::updated_datetime_str(&amp;updated)),
            ),
            (&quot;entries&quot;.into(), to_liquid_val(entries)),
        ]);
        self.templates
            .pages
            .atom
            .render(&amp;globals)
            .expect(&quot;failed to render atom feed&quot;)
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Amazingly, once the compiler was satisfied, this worked on the first try!
I honestly don't think I could have written something like this in Python,
which has been my primary language at work for five years, and gotten it
to work without extensive testing and tweaking.</p>
<p>From there, it's just a matter of adding links to the RSS feed from the
main page!</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">atom specification</a> is thorough and easy to follow, although you'll
probably still want some extra resources (like the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/atom.html">W3C atom intro</a>) for
when you get confused.</p>
<p>The architecture of my site generator is coming along nicely. There's still
a fair bit of what feels like busy work when adding a new template, because
it needs to be added in one way or another in three separate places.
Making this smoother with a macro or something similar might be the focus
of a future piece.</p>
<p>Rust is a great functional language! Sometimes you've got to really think
about how to do something functional, but it's almost always possible.</p>
