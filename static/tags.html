We must therefore be explicit in our expectations and hiring that good communication is just as important as technical ability.

    <a href="/posts/rustconf-2020.html">RustConf 2020</a>
    &mdash; Rust has been the world's most-loved programming language for five years running. That's a remarkable feat, especially for a language that, particularly back in 2015, was barely even a blip on the list of most-used languages. That fact that so many people who used Rust wanted to keep working with it was one of the main things that made me want to try it out, leading it to become my most-loved programming language too. This was my first year attending RustConf, albeit virtually. Thanks to the conference, for the first time I feel like I really understand what has led to Rust being not only a great language, but a lovable one. I came away from the conference more bullish than ever that Rust adoption will continue to grow in every space where anyone chances to use it. In this post, I'll talk about some of the things that really stood out to me as highlighting what makes Rust special, along with some of the reasons why I think Rust is poised to grow substantially even outside of its originally-intended niche of systems programming.

    &mdash; Rust has been the world's most-loved programming language for five years running. That's a remarkable feat, especially for a language that, particularly back in 2015, was barely even a blip on the list of most-used languages. That fact that so many people who used Rust wanted to keep working with it was one of the main things that made me want to try it out, leading it to become my most-loved programming language too. This was my first year attending RustConf, albeit virtually. Thanks to the conference, for the first time I feel like I really understand what has led to Rust being not only a great language, but a lovable one. I came away from the conference more bullish than ever that Rust adoption will continue to grow in every space where anyone chances to use it. In this post, I'll talk about some of the things that really stood out to me as highlighting what makes Rust special, along with some of the reasons why I think Rust is poised to grow substantially even outside of its originally-intended niche of systems programming.

    &mdash; It&rsquo;s been a minute since I put out a list of selected reads, which means we&rsquo;ve got quite a few today. Lots of Rust, as usual, but also some politics, an article on VSCode, and another Bret Devereux post on academics.

    &mdash; Communication is fundamental to the success of an engineering organization, and communication as a core value must be actively promoted in order for the organization to be successful. Most of our necessary communication is either for purposes of learning or education, and it should be expected that leadership roles involve a substantial amount of educational communication. We must therefore be explicit in our expectations and hiring that good communication is just as important as technical ability. To ensure we can evaluate these expectations for current and future employees, we must codify what we mean by good communication and ensure that we take steps to share and enforce that vision.

    &mdash; Make and its associated Makefiles have been around forever, and have gotten a bit of a bad rap due to people encountering and writing arcane, poorly documented examples. However, learning to use Make effectively can provide a significant benefit to modern software projects, enabling intelligent ordering and dependency management for common tasks that would be a nightmare to implement from scratch. In this article we'll cover the basics of Makefiles and how they can be useful in the context of a modern scripting language like JavaScript or Python.
