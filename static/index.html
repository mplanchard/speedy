        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Matthew Planchard, and I'm a software engineer
            living in Austin, TX. This is a blog I maintain mostly for
            the purpose of playing around with whatever technologies
            I'm interested in at the present.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you particularly enjoy anything here and want to drop me
            a line, you can find my contact information on the
            <a href="/about.html">about</a> page. If you're curious about
            the technical details behind this website, that stuff is there,
            too.
        </p>

    <a href="/posts/communication-education-and-engineering.html">Communication, Education, and Engineering</a>
    &mdash; Communication is fundamental to the success of an engineering organization, and communication as a core value must be actively promoted in order for the organization to be successful. Most of our necessary communication is either for purposes of learning or education, and it should be expected that leadership roles involve a substantial amount of educational communication. We must therefore be explicit in our expectations and hiring that good communication is just as important as technical ability. To ensure we can evaluate these expectations for current and future employees, we must codify what we mean by good communication and ensure that we take steps to share and enforce that vision.

    <a href="/posts/make-and-makefiles-are-awesome.html">Make and Makefiles are Awesome</a>
    &mdash; Make and its associated Makefiles have been around forever, and have gotten a bit of a bad rap due to people encountering and writing arcane, poorly documented examples. However, learning to use Make effectively can provide a significant benefit to modern software projects, enabling intelligent ordering and dependency management for common tasks that would be a nightmare to implement from scratch. In this article we'll cover the basics of Makefiles and how they can be useful in the context of a modern scripting language like JavaScript or Python.
